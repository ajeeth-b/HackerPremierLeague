**Leaderboard Scoring Criteria:**

- A win will give 3 points to a team

Implement a backend in .NET/Java/C#/NodeJS/Python.

- The teams and their matches pairing should be attached to the database with appropriate models. (MongoDB).
- Every pairing should send a win/loss/tie of the specific team to the database. It must then be fetched in the Leaderboard in real time.
- Pagination of data
- Database
